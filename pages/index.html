  <h1>Site redesign</h1>
  <p>As is my want, I'm replacing my old Wordpress powered blog site, with a new site powered by ruhoh.</p>
  <p>The aim is to start blogging more (my last post was June 2011 so shouldn't be hard to improve on that record), and
  expand the coverage to code snippets and technology projects as well as continuing to post recipes.</p>
