summary: "The buzz of getting involved in Open Source communities, and giving back."
type: draft

Since the beginning of March, I've given my first presentations to the Drupal community. I started at Drupalcamp London's business day on 1st March, then 2 days later a technical talk also at Drupalcamp, and then most recently a talk to the Large Scale Drupal quarterly meeting.

I've been a relatively passive member of the Drupal community for several years now, going to Drupalcons, contributing a few patches and maintaining my own small module, but always being more of an observer than a contributor.
